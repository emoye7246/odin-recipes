        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 &#189; teaspoons of brown sugar</li>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <p><li><strong>Prep seasonings:</strong> Combine all seasonings in a bowl and set aside.</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Form patties:</strong> Divide ground chuck into 6 equal portions and gently form into ½ inch thick patties that are wider than the burger buns (as they will shrink).  Use your thumb to press an indentation into the center of each patty. Cover and set aside.</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Grill:</strong> Just before cooking, sprinkle seasoning over the patties, then place on hot grill, indent-side up. Close grill lid and cook for 3-4 minutes, until the bottom of the burger is seared and juices are accumulating on top of the burger. Flip and cook an additional 3-4 minutes or until the beef reaches 160 degrees F. If adding cheese, place cheese slices on burgers during the last minute of cooking.</li></p>
            <p><li><strong>Serve:</strong> Remove patties to a plate and allow to rest for a few minutes before serving in a bun, with toppings.</li></p>
        </ol>

        <h4>How to know when your burger is ready to go</h4>
            <p><strong><em>(Note)</em></strong> The cooking temperature recommendation for burgers of medium doneness is 160 degrees F. If you don’t want to use a thermometer, here’s a rough estimate for how long to cook burgers on each side.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 minutes for medium rare</li>
            <li>3-4 minutes for medium <em>(this is the preffered)</em></li>
            <li>5-6 minutes for well done</li>
        </ul>
