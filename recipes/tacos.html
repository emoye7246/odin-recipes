        <p><h3>Elis Famous tacos</h3></p>

        <p>In this recipe we wille create an all time favorite dish, what I love most about this dish most is how easy and cheap you need to create it as the saying goes, you only need a little to do alot. I love this recipe with a nice cool bottle of pineapple jarritos
            just wash down all the flavors that we will consume.
        </p>

        <p>It is imporrtant to understand when to use this recipe it shouldnt be an everyday thing as things tend to lose its spice or excitemnt the more you repeat so try and use this recipe when... ahh what am i even saying
            ive been eating this recipe for three days straight and I haven't gotten sick of it yet bring the jarritos.

        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

            <ul>
               <p><li>Ground Beef: Note that meat that you chose is based on preference but We typically use 85% lean ground beef, however any variety works well. You can also use ground chicken or ground turkey to make this recipe.</li></p>
                <p><li>Homemade Taco seasonings: I always have a batch of this in a jar in my spice cabinet. My entire family agrees it’s the best (and far better than any store-bought varieties). If you prefer to use store-bought, I suggest making sure you chose an organic variety without fillers/artificial ingredients. Two of our favorites are Siete Foods and Simply Organic. 
                    But feel free to spice it up and put your own flair on it
                </p>
                <p><li>1 onion: We usually use sweet white or yellow onions, however red onion tastes great too.</li></p>
                <p><li>Lime Juice: <em>Trust me</em></li></p>
                <p><li>Minced Garlic: I buy organic minced garlic in a jar and use that since I don’t ever seem to have time to mince fresh garlic. But you can choose whichever you prefer.</li></p>
                <p><li>JARRITOOOOOSSSS! : BECAUSE ITS AWESOME.</li></p>
                
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

            <p>We are going to break this down a little bit by first describing the steps needed in order to first create the ground beef </p>
            
            <ol>
               <p><li>Begin by cooking the ground beef, onion and garlic covered over medium-high heat until the ground beef begins to brown and is no longer pink in the center, stirring often.
                Depending on the fat content of your ground beef, you may want to strain some of the fat off as it cooks. Don’t drain it all, though. It adds flavor and absorbs/distributes the taco seasoning. Also, the meat mixture thickens as it cools slightly.
                </li></p>
               <p><li>Once the ground beef begins to brown, add the homemade taco seasoning and stir until it’s evenly distributed.</li></p>
               <p><li>Next, add the lime juice and stir to combine. Cook, uncovered, until the mixture is browned, stirring occasionally.</li></p>
               <p><li>Once the ground beef is browned, transfer it to a serving dish and serve.</li></p>

            </ol>
            
            <h3>Serve</h3>

            <p>Serve these ground beef tacos in your favorite tortillas or taco shells (or use it to make the best homemade nachos, a delicious taco salad or ground beef enchiladas). I recommend a dollop of sour cream and cheese of course, along with some of our favorite Mexican recipes more on that later.</p>
